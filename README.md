# Unity Infinite List

An example of an infinite scrolling list in Unity. 
Much better performance than creating a bunch of ui objects for your list, as this solution will only use the amount of prefabs that are visible in your list.  
This is just an example and it's pretty scuffed, but it's just mean to be a rough outline of how you can do this lol
