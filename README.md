# Unity Infinite List

An example of an infinite scrolling list in Unity. Creating a bunch of UI objects = bad. This uses only as many UI objects that are visible in your list. 
The code is pretty scuffed, and it's only meant to serve as an example of how you can create something like this in Unity.
You probably wanna expand on the code and fix some shit, but maybe this example can help you save some time
